# Running the StockTicker Sample

Since this sample is demonstrating the use of an Emmit client and server, it includes an angular-seed app
taken from [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) which has been modified to pull in the angular-emmit-client bower package.

To run this sample, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the Emmit.Samples repository

  ```
  git clone git@github.com:eirwin/Emmit.Samples
  ```

2. Run the following from a command prompt or shell that has `node package manager (npm)` installed.
    
    ```
    cd Emmit.Samples/StockTicker/angular-seed
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

3. Browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html`
    
4. Run the `StockTicker` console application from Visual Studio or a command prompt.
